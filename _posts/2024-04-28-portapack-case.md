After almost five attempts, and going through three different brands of filaments, I have finally succeeded in printing a case for my Portapack H1! The translucent enclosure looks amazing, especialLy when the LED are lit up.

I used the Elegoo PLA PLus (clear).

Next, I would like to try different printing settings to maximize the clarity of print. A few things to try are:

- Slower printing speed
- Larger layer thickness
- Turn off cooling
- Higher print temperature
