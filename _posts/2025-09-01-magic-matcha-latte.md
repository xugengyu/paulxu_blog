<h4> Ingredients </h4>

- 1 teaspoon of ceremonial grade matcha powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of powdered cordyceps
- 1/2 teaspoon of powdered lion's mane
- 1/2 teaspoon of can sugar
- 1 cup of unsweetened oat milk

<h4> Comments </h4>
I might cut back on the cordyceps and lionâ€™s mane, or increase the amount of matcha powder; the flavor is a bit too earthy for my liking.
