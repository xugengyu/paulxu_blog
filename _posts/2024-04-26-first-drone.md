I just got my hands on the DJI Mini 3, my very first drone! Flying a drone has been a dream of mine for years, and this purchase certainly did not disappoint.

Now, onto the exciting part: scouting out safe locations with stunning scenery to capture!

As a side note, I have always admired DJI's extraordinary engineering. In my opinion, it's one of the most innovative companies in the world right now.
