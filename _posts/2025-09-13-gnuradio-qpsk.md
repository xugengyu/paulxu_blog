In this post I will deep dive into how to construct an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) wireless system using GNU Radio and two HackRF Software Defined Radios (SDR). We will try to transfer an image over-the-air using QPSK modulation, and then demodulate the signal to recover the image.
