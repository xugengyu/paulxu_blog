title: About Me
---

I am an antenna/radio-frequency engineer working in the Greater Seattle Area specializing in phased array antenna systems.

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto.

I like to learn about random things that may or may not be related to my field of work; some of them are documented on my [notes](notes.md) page.
