title: About Me
---

I am an Antenna engineer working in the Greater Seattle Area.

I specialize in:

- phased array antenna systems
- wireless communication
- digital signal processing

I like to learn about random things that may or may not be related to my field; some of them are documented on my [notes](notes.md) page.
