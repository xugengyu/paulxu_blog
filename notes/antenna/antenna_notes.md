<h3> Notes on Antenna Engineering </h3>

<!---This is a collection of RF engineering topics I've come across during my studies and professional experience. I will update it regularly as I continue to learn and explore more in the field.

Some of the explanations are based on my own intuition and understanding. If you notice any errors, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
