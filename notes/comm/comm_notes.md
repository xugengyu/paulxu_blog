<h3> Notes on Communication Systems </h3>

This collection covers topics in digital signal processing (DSP) and communication theory that Iâ€™ve been exploring as a hobby. Rather than relying on heavy mathematics, my aim is to develop intuition by emphasizing geometric interpretations.

<h4> Basic DSP Operations </h4>

- Discrete Fourier Transform
- Convolution
- Cross-correlation
