I have found the following settings to work well with the Amazon Basic slik PLA filament.

- Nozzle temperature: 200$^\circ$C
- Bed temperature:
    - First layer: 65$^\circ$C
    - After: 55$^\circ$C

Amazon recommends printing with an unheated bed. But I have found that plastic shrinks to much and has trouble adhering to the bed.
