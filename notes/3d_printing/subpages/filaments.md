Here I review some of the 3D printing filaments that I have used.

### Amazon Basic Silk PLA Filament
I have only tried the white slik PLA from Amazon, and I don't think I will be purchasing it again. My prints consistently turned out stringy and lacked mechanical strength

If you would like to try this filament, I would suggest not following the recommended bed temperature, which is unheated. This frequently caused the prints to warp and lift off from the bed. I've had better results using a bed temperature of 65°C for the first layer and 50°C for subsequent layers.

I love the colors though. :)

### Creality (Basic PLA)

### Elegoo PLA Filament
